# slackbot

katjabot can interact with the members of the JS-SF-7 team in the following ways:

- anytime someone mentions 'beer garden', it will inform the user that it, too, loves beer gardens
- when someone addresses katjabot with either 'hallo' (regular German) or 'servus' (Bavarian dialect), it will respond with the untranslateable regional greeting "Alm√§chd naa!"
- anytime someone mentions sloths, it will serve up a random sloth image. just coz
- finally, the 'dream crusher': when a user completes the sentence "when i grow up i want to be a " with any job other than 'javascript developer', katjabot will respond with "But XXXs don't make any money!"
